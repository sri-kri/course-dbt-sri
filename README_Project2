What is our user repeat rate?

with data as 
(Select 
    user_id, count(1) as num_orders
    from dbt_sk.stg_users
    LEFT JOIN dbt_sk.stg_orders using (user_id)
    group by 1 
)

Select 
    sum(case when num_orders >1 then 1 else 0 end) as sum_users_2more_orders,
    count(1) as total_users,
    (sum(case when num_orders >1 then 1 else 0 end)::float / count(1)) *100 as pct_users_2more_orders

a: 79%

What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?

a: Good indicators include session/browsing history for the user. A user that has more session activity would most likely purchase again vs someone who doesn't have as much browsing activity. In addition, data about items in user's carts that have not bene purchases will be a good indicator of future purchases/conversions.

More stakeholders are coming to us for data, which is great! But we need to get some more models created before we can help. Create a marts folder, so we can organize our models, with the following subfolders for business units:

Core
a: done 

Marketing
a: done 

Product
a: done 

Organized high level summary views per functional area with key data elements that are appropriate for those functions. Data that is appropriate for cross functional groups will be stored in the core mart
